**Tank Trouble** is a game made from unreal engine 5.6 taking from inspiration the "Battle Blaster" section of the game development in unreal engine 5 course on Udemy.
The project is still in development and the goal is to release a multiplayer gamemode which will be at least available for local players and also create bot enemy tanks to fill rooms.
